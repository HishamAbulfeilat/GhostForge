# GhostForge — Session Handoff (read this first)

**Any AI, any provider, any new session: this is the one file that tells you
what is going on.** The top half is written by humans/lead agents; the
`LIVE STATUS` block at the bottom is rewritten automatically by the boss every
couple of minutes while the agent team runs.

## Mission

Make GhostForge production-perfect: every feature works end to end and is
reachable from the **web UI, TUI, terminal CLI and JARVIS**; the Electron app
runs on **Windows, macOS and Linux** and the **Android** app builds; security
is hardened; the **Agentic OS dashboard** (`/agents`) shows every agent's
progress. Keep going until every check is green, then keep improving.

## How the work runs (autonomous agent team)

- **Boss** — `scripts/agents/boss.mjs` (Node, detached). The only writer of the
  board and the only one that merges/pushes. Loop: assign tasks → worker
  commits in its own worktree → boss **reviews** (read-only model run) →
  merges into `agent/integration` → health check (rolls back regressions) →
  every 5 merges pushes `agent/integration` and updates **one PR to `main`**
  (never auto-merges). When the board is empty it runs the full health score;
  failing checks become tasks, and at 100/100 it plans the next tasks toward
  the current phase goal (phase 4 = the mission above).
- **Boss model** — `claude` / `opus`, **fallback `copilot`**: when Claude is out
  of quota the boss cools Claude down and reviews/plans with Copilot, then
  retries Claude later. (`.agent-sync/team.json` → `boss`.)
- **Workers** — `claude` (worktree `../gf-claude`) plus five Copilot CLI
  workers: `copilot-tui`, `copilot-desktop`, `copilot-web`,
  `copilot-integration`, `copilot-quality` (`../gf-boss-*`). A rate-limited
  worker cools down 20 min and its task goes back to the queue, so Copilot
  keeps going when Claude hits its limit and vice versa.
- **Skills for workers** — ECC v2.2.2 (pinned, `.agent-sync/ecc.json`) is
  staged per task into `.agent-sync/state/ecc-context.md` for every worker
  (Copilot included). The Claude worker also loads the native Claude plugins
  on this machine (ECC, oh-my-claudecode, superpowers).
- **Watchdog** — `scripts/agents/watchdog.mjs`, run every 5 min by the Windows
  scheduled task **"GhostForge Boss Watchdog"**; restarts the boss if it died.
  An explicit `team.mjs stop` (STOP file) is respected.

## Operate it

| Want to… | Command |
|---|---|
| See status | `npm run agents:status` · dashboard `http://localhost:3000/agents` (admin login) |
| Add a task | `node scripts/agents/team.mjs add "title" --area path/` |
| Message the team / boss | `node scripts/agents/team.mjs say boss "…"` |
| Stop (stays stopped) | `npm run agents:stop` |
| Start / resume | `npm run agents:watchdog` (starts the boss if down) |
| Remove the scheduler | `node scripts/agents/watchdog.mjs --uninstall` |
| Logs | `.agent-sync/state/boss.log`, `.agent-sync/state/logs/<agent>.log` |
| Board / messages (raw) | `.agent-sync/state/board.json`, `.agent-sync/state/messages.jsonl` |

## Taking over as a new lead (Claude, Copilot, or any other model)

1. `git status` on `feat/agent-boss` in `GhostForge-public`; read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read the LIVE STATUS block below and `.agent-sync/state/boss.log` tail.
3. Review what merged since you last looked:
   `git log --oneline feat/agent-boss..agent/integration`.
4. Unblock **blocked** tasks (they failed 3 attempts): fix directly, or re-queue
   with better notes via `team.mjs add`.
5. Don't run a second boss — `boss.pid` is a lock; the watchdog restarts it.

## Branches

- `main` — protected; changes arrive only via the agent-team PR.
- `feat/agent-boss` — this checkout; agent framework + everything integrated so far.
- `agent/integration` — the boss's merge branch (worktree `../gf-integration`), PR → `main`.
- `agent/<provider>/…` — per-worker branches, reset onto integration before each task.

## History

- **2026-09-30** — PRs #6–#10 merged (marketplace source of truth, Mark-LV +
  OpenJarvis bridge, Job Hunter autopilot, workflows engine). Built the
  boss/worker framework; Copilot ran it: 76 commits (agent-team API +
  `/agents` dashboard, TUI/JARVIS agent-team controls, templates,
  OpenAI-compatible provider, security fixes, Playwright/TUI/Electron tests).
- **2026-10-01 ~01:30** — Claude took over as boss: merged `agent/integration`
  into `feat/agent-boss` (ECC context layer + hardened prompt staging), added
  phase 4 (the mission), Claude boss with Copilot fallback, Claude worker,
  watchdog + scheduled task, and this auto-updated handoff.

## Environment gotchas

- Windows host, no tmux; Git Bash + PowerShell. Node v23 (odd release — some
  native modules have no prebuilds, e.g. the `omc` CLI's better-sqlite3).
- `gh` must be logged in as **HishamAbulfeilat** (a second account,
  `habulfeilat_ejadasa`, caused 403 push failures before 2026-10-01).
- Worker worktrees live next to the repo: `C:\Users\User\Desktop\gf-*`.
